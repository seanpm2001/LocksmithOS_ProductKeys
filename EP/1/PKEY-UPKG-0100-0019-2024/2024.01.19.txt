PKEY-UPKG-0100-0019-2024 (Product Key Unit Package)
A customized package for managing product keys of various programs
Defined due to the discovery of a wide range of product key usage that I didn't expect. Even Angry Birds (PC) versions had product keys.
Customizable environment (custom background, data entry and storage formats)
